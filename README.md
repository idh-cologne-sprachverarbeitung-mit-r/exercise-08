# Exercise 8

**In General**: Please ask questions in the [ilias-Forum](https://www.ilias.uni-koeln.de/ilias/goto_uk_frm_3270419.html) for this course, so that others can also see the question and answer*.

*Please submit your solutions to this exercise until June 26th.*

The goal of this exercise is to get to learn about regular expressions.

*Note*: There is no automatic testing this week (because it caused more issues than it solved). Instead, the task descriptions below also state expected results for some inputs.

## Step 1

The relevant reading this week is section 4.4 in [Desagulier (2017)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319645704).

## Step 2

Clone this repository. The same as last week.

In the examples, I'll use "Textanalyse-mit-R", you should replace this with the path to your directory: `cd Textanalyse-mit-R`. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/idh-cologne-sprachverarbeitung-mit-r/exercise-08.git`. Enter the directory `cd exercise-08`. Create a new branch for you: `git checkout -b USERNAME`.

## Step 3
Again (as last week), open the file `R/exercise.R` in your favorite text editor. Depending on your operating system and settings, double clicking may open an editor that came with the R installation. The directory `data` contains a few files weâ€˜ll be using in the exercises.

This week we will continue doing corpus analysis using the functions established last week. I.e., please copy the functions `readCorpus()` and `removeStopwords()` from exercise 7 (either your own or the reference solutions).






## Step 4
Don't forget to save your file.
Now turning back to git: Add your file to the staging area (`git add R/exercise.R`), commit it (`git commit -m ""`, you need to fill in a commit message), and push it to the server (`git push --set-upstream origin BRANCHNAME`).
